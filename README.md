# Project-One

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
We are building a user-friendly hiking trail application where you will be able to view trails in major cities. The user will be able to select the city, then a list of trails will populate. The user will be able to click into those trails to read a bit more about it and other users who have walked the trails. The user will be able to create and delete trails.

Stretch Goals
User authentication 
User can only delete trails they created themselves.
User has option to upload a picture from their hike.
